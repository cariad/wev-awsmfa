## üî• The Problem

Say your IAM user policy requires you to verify your identity via multi-factor authentication.

This limits your ability to use the `aws` CLI because you can't provide MFA tokens with your requests.

`wev-awsmfa` extends [wev](https://github.com/cariad/wev) to prompt for your one-time tokens and authenticate you automatically.

## üéÅ Installation

`wev-awsmfa` requires Python 3.8 or later and `wev`.

```bash
python -m pip install wev
python -m pip install wev-awsmfa
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Filename and location

See [wevcli.app/configuration](https://wevcli.app/configuration) for a detailed guide to `wev` configuration files.

If in doubt, create your configuration file as `wev.yml` in your project directory.

### Keys

`wev-awsmfa` must be configured to resolve three environment variables:

| Index | Description       | Suggested name          |
|------:|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 0     | AWS access key ID | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     |
| 1     | AWS secret key    | `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` |
| 2     | AWS session token | `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`     |

### Properties

`wev-awsmfa` supports two optional properties:

| Property   | Description                                  | Default                                   |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| duration   | Duration of the temporary session in seconds | 900                                       |
| mfa_device | ARN of the multi-factor device to use        | _Attempt to discover automatically._ |

### Examples

#### Minimal configuration

```yaml
[AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SESSION_TOKEN]:
  plugin:
    id: wev-awsmfa
```

#### 30-second sessions

```yaml
[AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SESSION_TOKEN]:
  plugin:
    id: wev-awsmfa
    duration: 1800
    mfa_device: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/foo
```

## üíª Usage

Run `wev` with any command that requires a multi-factor authenticated session.

For example, to run `aws s3 ls` in a multi-factor authenticated session:

```bash
wev aws s3 ls
```

You'll be prompted to enter your one-time token, then `wev` will authenticate you and run the command.
